The ServiceCollection class implements IServiceCollection interface. See the ServiceCollection source code here.

So, the services you add in the IServiceCollection type instance, it actually creates an instance of ServiceDescriptor and adds it to the list.

IServiceProvider :
IServiceProvider includes GetService method. The ServiceProvider class implements IServiceProvider interface which returns registered services with the container. We cannot instantiate ServiceProvider class because its constructors are marked with internal access modifier.

ServiceCollectionContainerBuilderExtensions class includes BuildServiceProvider extension method which creates and returns an instance of ServiceProvider.
